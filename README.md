# üç´ Choco Finance

## What is Choco Finance?&#x20;

Choco Finance is Theta Network's first decentralized reserve currency protocol operating on the BARS token. Each BARS token is backed by an array of assets (e.g. USDC, TFUEL, THETA) in the Choco treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Choco also brings economic dynamics into the Theta ecosystem through molding (staking) and melting (bonding/minting).&#x20;

## Why Makes Choco Diffrent?&#x20;

Choco Finance attempts to solve the developer-oriented space of DeFi, by creating a project more focused on the community, and less on the developers. The trust between both sides of the project is built by removing all developer anonymity and giving the community all developer wallets. On top of this, APYs and ROIs will be adjusted on the fly through community snapshots and proposals. These rates will be determined in a manner that keeps inflation low and sustainable.

## What is the Marketing Fee?

Currently, Choco Finance takes no cut toward marketing. This is subject to change through community revision. If the community decides to introduce a marketing fee it will be applied to all transactions.

## What is the Developer Fee?

At launch, Choco will have a 2% fee applied to all assets entering the treasury (melted tokens), meaning no cut will be taken from molding. Thus, the fee only impacts the growth rate of the treasury's intrinsic value and does not impact melting ROIs or melting APYs. Since the fee is never applied to BARS, **developers will never receive or hold BARS**. All fees are not set in stone and can be changed with future community revisions.

## What is the point of Choco?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the BARS token is controlled at a high level by the deployed smart contracts. In the long term, this system will optimize stability and consistency so BARS will function as a Theta unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency for creators and users on Theta's upcoming Web 3.0 developments. In the short term, we intend to optimize Choco for stable and sustainable growth.

## How do I participate in Choco?

There are two methods of market participation: molding and melting. Molders mold their BARS tokens for more BARS in return, while melters provide LP (Liquidity-Pool) Tokens or other treasury-accepted assets in exchange for discounted BARS tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved in our community through discussions on our official discord and telegram servers. We are always looking for new community members to contribute!

## How can I benefit from Choco?

Molders mainly benefit from supply growth; the protocol melts new BARS tokens from the treasury, most of which are distributed to the molders. Thus, the gain for molders will come from their auto-compounding balances.

Melters mainly benefit from price consistency. Melters commit capital upfront and are guaranteed a fixed return at a predetermined future date. Melters benefit from low volatility in BARS price.

## Who runs Choco?

No one. Choco is community-governed. All decisions and proposals are formed by the people and made by token holders.
