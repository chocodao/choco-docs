# üç´ Choco Finance

## What is Choco Finance?&#x20;

Choco Finance is Theta Network's first decentralized reserve currency protocol operating on the BARS token. Each BARS token is backed by an array of assets (e.g. USDC, TFUEL) in the Choco treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Choco also brings economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the Theta ecosystem through molding (staking) and melting (bonding/minting).&#x20;

## Why Makes Choco Diffrent?&#x20;

Choco Finance attempts to solve the developer-oriented space of DeFi, by creating a project more focused on the community, and less on the developers. The trust between both sides of the project is built by removing all developer anonymity and giving the community all dev wallets. On top of this, APYs and ROIs will be adjusted on the fly through community snapshots and proposals. These rates will be determined in a way that keeps inflation rates low and sustainable.

## What is the Marketing Fee?

Currently Choco Finance takes no cut toward marketing. This is subject to change through community revision. If the community decides to introduce a marketing fee it will be applied to all transactions, currently no marketing fee.

## What is the Dev Fee?

At launch, Choco will have a 2% fee applied to all assets entering the treasury (melted tokens). This fee only applies to melting, so no dev cut will be taken from molding, meaning the fee only impacts the growth rate of the treasury's intrinsic value but has no impact on melting ROIs or melting APYs. Since the fee is never applied to BARS, **the devs will never receive or hold the token**. The percent fee is not set in stone and can be changed with future community revisions.

## What is the point of Choco?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the BARS token is controlled at a high level by the deployed smart contracts. In the long term, this system can be used to optimize stability and consistency so BARS can function as a Theta unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency for creators and users on Theta's upcoming Web 3.0 developments. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I participate in Choco?

There are two main strategies for market participants: molding and melting. Molders mold their BARS tokens in return for more BARS tokens, while melters provide LP or other treasury accepted assets in exchange for discounted BARS tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved in our community through discussions on our official discord and telegram servers. We are always looking for new community members to contribute!

## How can I benefit from Choco?

The main benefit for molders comes from supply growth. The protocol melts new BARS tokens from the treasury, most of which are distributed to the molders. Thus, the gain for molders will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), molders will make a profit.

The main benefit for melters comes from price consistency. Melters commit capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in BARS and thus the melters' profit would depend on the BARS price when the melting matures. Melters benefit from a rising or static BARS price.

## Who runs Choco?

No one. Choco is community-governed. All decisions and proposals are formed by the people and made by token holders.
