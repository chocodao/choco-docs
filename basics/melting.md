# Melting

## What is Melting?

**Melting is the secondary value accrual strategy of Choco.** It allows for the treasury to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets such as THETA by selling BARS at a discount in exchange for these assets. The protocol quotes the melter with terms such as the melting price, the amount of BARS tokens entitled to the melter, and the vesting term. The melter can claim some of the BARS rewards as they vest. At the end of the vesting period, the full amount will be claimable.

**Melting is an active, short-term strategy.** The price discovery mechanism of the secondary melt market renders melting discounts more or less unpredictable. Therefore melting is considered a more active investment strategy that has to be monitored constantly in order to be more profitable as compared to molding.

**Melting allows Choco to accumulate its own liquidity.** More protocol owned liquidity ensures there is always locked exit liquidity in our trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders. Since Choco becomes its own market the protocol accrues part of its revenue from LP rewards bolstering its treasury.
