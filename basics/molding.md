# Molding

## What is Molding?

**Molding is one of the primary value accrual strategies of Choco.** Molders mold their BARS on the Choco website to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceeds of melting pot sales and can vary based on the number of BARS molded in the protocol and the reward rate set by the community-derived smart contract.

**Molding is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your BARS form principle is exponential. So the longer you mold, the higher the rate at which your BARS grows.

**When you mold, you lock BARS and receive an equal amount of WRPR.** Your WPR balance rebases automatically at the end of every epoch.&#x20;

**When you unmold, you burn WRPR and receive an equal amount of BARS.** Unmolding means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unmolded amount; the remaining WRPR (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
