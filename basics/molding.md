# Molding

## What is Molding?

**Molding is the primary value accrual strategy of Choco.** Molders mold their BARS on the Choco website to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from melting pot sale proceeds, and can vary based on the number of BARS molded in the protocol and the reward rate set by the community-derived smart contract.

**Molding is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your mold of BARS translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of BARS drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough molding period, the increase in your WRPR balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you mold, you lock BARS and receive an equal amount of WRPR.** Your WPR balance rebases automatically at the end of every epoch.&#x20;

**When you unmold, you burn WRPR and receive an equal amount of BARS.** Unmolding means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unmolded amount; the remaining WRPR (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
