# Glossary

## APR <a href="#apr" id="apr"></a>

Annual Percentage Rate, is the annualized interest rate without taking the effect of compounding into account.

## APY <a href="#apy" id="apy"></a>

Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are rather ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.

## MPCV <a href="#bcv" id="bcv"></a>

Melting Pot Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which melting prices change. A higher MPCV means a lower discount for melters and higher inflation by the protocol. A lower MPCV means a higher discount for melters and lower inflation by the protocol.

## DAO <a href="#dao" id="dao"></a>

Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. In Choco Finance the governance token is BARS. Once released, only BARS on the Theta Network can be used to vote. BARS deposited in a pool, or LP pairing cannot be used to vote.

## DCV <a href="#dcv" id="dcv"></a>

Deflation Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which protocol defined buy pressure changes. A higher DCV means more buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in a higher deflation. A lower DCV means less buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in a lower deflation.

## EVM <a href="#evm" id="evm"></a>

Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a state machine in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only one canonical state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to block.

## LP Tokens <a href="#liquidity-bonds" id="liquidity-bonds"></a>

Liquidity Pool Tokens are rewarded to users who provide crypto assets to a DeFi platform, and often come with benefits when it comes to staking and yield farming. Examples are BARS-TFUEL LP and BARS-FRAX LP melting pots.

## PCV <a href="#pcv" id="pcv"></a>

Protocol Controlled Value, is the amount of funds the treasury owns and controls. The more PCV the better for the protocol and its users.

## POL <a href="#pol" id="pol"></a>

Protocol Owned Liquidity, is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls. The more POL the better for the protocol and its users.

## PoR <a href="#por" id="por"></a>

Proof of Reserve, is the mechanism of strengthening the reserve of the Choco treasury via the sales of melting pots. Melters provide liquidity to the treasury, thereby building its reserve. In return for their service, Melters get paid in BARS.

## Reserve Melting Pots <a href="#reserve-bonds" id="reserve-bonds"></a>

Reserve melting pots are single assets only. Examples are TFUEL and USDC melting pots.

## Reward Rate <a href="#reward-rate" id="reward-rate"></a>

Reward rate is the configured percentage of BARS distributed to all molders on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely set by the policy team.

## Reward Yield <a href="#reward-yield" id="reward-yield"></a>

Reward yield refers to the actual amount of BARS received by each molder on each rebase. The reward yield is a rough target from a policy point of view. It can almost never be maintained precisely due to e.g. fluctuating amounts of BARS molded.

## RFV <a href="#rfv" id="rfv"></a>

Risk Free Value, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing BARS.

## TLP <a href="#slp" id="slp"></a>

ThetaSwap Liquidity Provider, is the token received when providing liquidity on ThetaSwap.io

## TVL <a href="#tvl" id="tvl"></a>

Total Value Locked, is the dollar amount of all BARS molded in the protocol. This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects.

## TaaS <a href="#taas" id="taas"></a>

Treasury as a Service, is the business model of decentralized custody of partnership funds. Choco Finance is designed for TaaS by selling melting pots and absorbing partners' liquidity into its treasury as a result.

## TWAP <a href="#twap" id="twap"></a>

Time Weighted Average Price, is the average price of an asset over a specified time. TWAPs are used to represent the fair value of an asset as defined by the market.
