# Glossary

## APR <a href="#apr" id="apr"></a>

The annual Percentage Rate is the annualized interest rate without taking the effect of compounding returns.

## APY <a href="#apy" id="apy"></a>

Annual Percentage Yield is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year.&#x20;

## MPCV <a href="#bcv" id="bcv"></a>

The melting Pot Control Variable is the scaling factor at which melting prices change. A higher MPCV means a lower discount for melters and higher inflation by the protocol. A lower MPCV means a higher discount for melters and lower inflation by the protocol.

## DAO <a href="#dao" id="dao"></a>

A decentralized Autonomous Organization is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. In Choco Finance the governance token is BARS. Once released, only BARS on the Theta Network can be used to vote. BARS deposited in a pool, or LP pairing cannot be used to vote.

## DCV <a href="#dcv" id="dcv"></a>

The deflation Control Variable is the scaling factor at which protocol-defined "buy pressure" changes. A higher DCV means more buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in more deflation. A lower DCV means less buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in less deflation.

## EVM <a href="#evm" id="evm"></a>

An Ethereum Virtual Machine is a state machine in which all accounts and smart contracts of the respective chain live. At any given block in the chain, the chain has one and only one canonical state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to block.

## LP Tokens <a href="#liquidity-bonds" id="liquidity-bonds"></a>

Liquidity Pool Tokens are rewarded proportionally to the amount of liquidity given to a DEX (Decnetized Exchange). The holder of the LP will earn a portion of the total fees generated from trades equal to their share of the total supply of the LP. Examples are BARS-TFUEL LP and BARS-USDC LP.

## PCV <a href="#pcv" id="pcv"></a>

Protocol Controlled Value is the USD price valuation of all the treasury's assets.

## POL <a href="#pol" id="pol"></a>

Protocol Owned Liquidity is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls. The more POL the better for the protocol and its users.

## PoR <a href="#por" id="por"></a>

Proof of Reserve is the mechanism of strengthening the reserve of the Choco treasury via the sales of melting pots. Melters provide liquidity to the treasury, thereby building its reserve. In return for their service, Melters get paid in BARS.

## Reserve Melting Pots <a href="#reserve-bonds" id="reserve-bonds"></a>

Reserve melting pots are single assets only. Examples are TFUEL and USDC melting pots.

## Reward Rate <a href="#reward-rate" id="reward-rate"></a>

The reward rate is the configured percentage of BARS distributed to all molders on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is set by the community.

## Reward Yield <a href="#reward-yield" id="reward-yield"></a>

Reward yield refers to the actual amount of BARS received by each molder on each rebase. The reward yield is an estimate; It can almost never be maintained precisely due to factors such as the fluctuating amount of BARS molded.

## RFV <a href="#rfv" id="rfv"></a>

The Risk Free Value is the valuation of the funds backing each BARS.

## TLP <a href="#slp" id="slp"></a>

ThetaSwap Liquidity Provider are the tokens received when providing liquidity on ThetaSwap.io

## TVL <a href="#tvl" id="tvl"></a>

Total Value Locked is the dollar amount of all BARS molded in the protocol. This metric is often used as a growth indicator in DeFi projects.

## TaaS <a href="#taas" id="taas"></a>

Treasury as a Service is the business model of decentralized custody of partnership funds. Choco Finance is designed for TaaS by selling melting pots and absorbing the melting pot's liquidity into its treasury.

## TWAP <a href="#twap" id="twap"></a>

Time Weighted Average Price, is the average price of an asset over a specified time. TWAPs are used to represent the fair value of an asset as defined by the market.
